 Autoconf Exception
 .
 As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited
 permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that
 are the output of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU
 General Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even
 though portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU
 General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the
 material that constitutes the Autoconf program.
 .
 Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be
 copied (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of
 Autoconf. We call these the "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf
 source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides
 which of the data portions to output in any given case. We call these
 comments and executable code the "non-data" portions. Autoconf never
 copies any of the non-data portions into its output.
 .
 This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf
 released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and
 distribute a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this
 special exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as
 well, *unless* your modified version has the potential to copy into
 its output some of the text that was the non-data portion of the
 version that you started with. (In other words, unless your change
 moves or copies text from the non-data portions to the data
 portions.) If your modification has such potential, you must delete
 any notice of this special exception to the GPL from your modified
 version.
